# ESP-IDF-ProjectTemplateCreator
A simple tool to create template of fresh new project for ESP32-IDF RTOS SDK

So I just introduced myself to RTOS SDK for ESP32 and after going through some example codes available I realised that I didn't knew how to make a completely new project.
After doing some Google, I still couldn't get a satisfactory solution for myself.
That's when I thought of writing a small tool to solve my problem.

Feel free to comment any mistakes, problems, coding inconsistencies.
Feel free to improve the project as per your own needs and ideas. 
Just let me know when you do that so that I can learn something new as well.
